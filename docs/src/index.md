# Your new digital atelier

Overtone is a music composition app for everybody. It's lightweight and not bug-prone.
The interface is clean and uncluttered, but no features missing. And most of all, free.

If you make soundtracks for film, or dynamic video game music...
If you make chip tunes on 8-bit trackers, or expressive orchestral scores...
If you make digital music with synths, or have a live recording studio...
If you call yourself a "producer," or a "composer" or you're just messing around,
[Overtone is for you!](./guides/user)
