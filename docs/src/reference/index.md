# Concepts

As a user, if you want to use Overtone, you ideally shouldn't have to read this.
The interface should be self-explanatory and intuitive, and you should just "get it."

To get to the "next level" at Overtone, or if you're planning to develop plugins or contribute,
this module contains the reference to all the standards and formats Overtone uses.
