# Reference

In order to use Overtone, you don't need to read this. The interface should be self-explanatory and intuitive,
and you should just "get it."

However, to be proficient at Overtone, or to develop for it, this module might be useful.
Here you can find references of all the formats and standards Overtone uses.
