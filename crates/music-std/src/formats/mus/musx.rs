//! # The MUSX (Musical Excerpt) format
//!
//! An excerpt of musical data that will be played
//! by a MUSi (Musical Instrument) or another MUS-compliant plugin.
//!
//! This format contains a bunch of notes in a sorted buffer,
//! such that they can be seeked efficiently using binary search.
//! Each note has
//!
//! It additionally contains two kinds of markers â€” time-bound and note-bound markers,
//! each which add additional notation to be interpreted by the MUSi.
//! These markers are also arbitrary. They may look something like this:
//!
//! `std::staccato`, `std::chord_stagger`, `std::artificial_harmonics`.
