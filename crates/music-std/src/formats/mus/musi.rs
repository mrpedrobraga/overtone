//! # MUSI (Musical Instrument)
//!
//! A simple sample library, similar to SoundFont, that can generate audio from music
//! using a format for arbitrary semantic music exchange (MUSX).
//! 
//! Each instruments carries:
//! - Samples, each annotated with parameters;
//! - A Sampling Scheme, which describes how to fulfill the request to play some note;
