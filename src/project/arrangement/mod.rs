//! # Arrangements
//!
//! The soul of an Overtone project is the arrangements.
//!
//! Arrangements combine [`Fragment`]s together to create things (i.e. songs, video).
//! Fragments themselves might be internally composed of sub-elements in a graph-like fashion.
//!
//! > This is a bit of an esoteric way of putting things, but the generality of this concept
//! > is why Overtone is so powerful.
//! >
//! > As an example, a Fragment of a song can be something like a single audio sample or a Piano Roll
//! > as it shows in the track editor. Internally, the individual notes of a piano roll are considered
//! > its elements, etc.
//!
//! An arrangement contains a single fragment, which seems to imply you can only have One Thing
//! in your song, but you can choose it to be a kind of fragment that itself can house many elements
//! like a Piano Roll, a Multi Type Fragment, etc.;
//!
//! ## Lazy Loading
//!
//! Fragments are lazy-loaded, this is so you can navigate through hundreds of thousands
//! of arrangements seamlessly. Furthermore, some Fragments are "owned" by the [`Project`]
//! allowing you to use it in many different arrangements.
//!
//! ## Serialization
//!
//! An arrangement is saved on disk as a folder, which allows you to see all of its parts.
