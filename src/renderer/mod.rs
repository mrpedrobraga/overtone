//! # Rendering
//!
//! A [`Renderer`] is an object that observes an [`Arrangement`] and produces an intermediary
//! object (`dyn RenderResult`) that can be either previewed or exported in different ways.
//!
//! ## Previewing
//!
//! Not available yet.
//!
//! ## Exporting
//!
//! [`RenderExporter`] is the trait for exporters, which you can have several of
//! for the same format of render result.
//!
//! The reason why it's a trait is if a song is rendered to, say, audio in PCM,
//! it can be encoded into WAV, OGG, MP3, etc.
